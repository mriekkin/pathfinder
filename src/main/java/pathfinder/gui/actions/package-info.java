/**
 * Actions which perform functions and can be attached to buttons or menu items.
 * <p>
 * Actions are action listeners which can be attached to components such as
 * buttons or menu items. The difference between actions and action listeners is
 * that actions add state state such as text, description and mnemonic. Thus
 * actions provide centralized handling of state, in particular when two or more
 * components perform the same function.
