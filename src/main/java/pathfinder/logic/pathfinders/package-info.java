/**
 * Algorithms for finding the shortest path between two nodes.
 * <p>
 * These algorithms implement "early exit" which means that the algorithms stop
 * after finding the destination node. Hence these algorithms find the shortest
 * path between the source node and the destination node, <i>not</i> between the
 * source node and all other nodes.
 * <p>
 * Otherwise these are mostly standard implementations which are described in a
 * number of sources. Used references include the book CLRS and the web site
 * listed below.
